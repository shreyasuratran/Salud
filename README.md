# Salud
Salud is a personal health companion that provides you with a list of recipes tailored to your health necessities based on the disease(s) you're battling as well as your food/cuisine preferences. It also streamlines the need for a care giver to handpick and order ingredients/food for patients. Instead, once a certain recipe/food item is picked by the user, it automatically adds all the necessary ingredients into an "instant-cart". Once the order the reviewed/altered and approved by the user, the order is placed and the necessary items are shipped directly to the user's home.
